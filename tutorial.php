            <h2><strong>To start</strong></h2>
            <p>If you haven’t done so yet please begin by doing <strong>-start</strong>, and then select a race and class.</p>
            <p>The bot will show you a list of possibilities and you can answer without using the ‘’<strong>-</strong>’’. </p>
            <p>Example of your input:</p>
            <p><strong>-start, human, thief.</strong></p>
            ‍

            <br>
            ‍<h2><strong>To help you on your way</strong></h2>
            <p>First you can get yourself some items to help you on your way.</p>
            <p>By doing <strong>-daily</strong> once a day you receive some items.</p>
            ‍
            <p>Another optional way of gaining items is voting for Solyx on top.gg through <strong>-vote.</strong></p>
            <p>This will take some time to register, please wait for this to happen, it will notify you of this.</p>
            ‍
            <p>Now you should have some potions, you can use these by doing -heal during a fight with a monster.</p>
            <p>You now also possess some gold.</p>

            <p>Gold is the main currency in this game, one of the things you can buy are potions through</p>
            <p><strong>‍-hp buy <amount></strong>.</p>
            ‍
            <p>Or view weapons and armor through <strong>-shop</strong> (weapons/armor).</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>‍<strong>-shop weapons & -hp buy 5.</strong></p>

            <h2><strong>Your first battle</strong></h2>
            <p>Now you are ready to start your first battle!</p>
            <p>To start fighting do <strong>-fight</strong> and it will find a monster nearby, it will ask you if you wish to fight this monster.</p>
            <p>Say ‘’<strong>yes</strong>’’ (without -).</p>
            ‍
            <p>You are now engaged in your first fight.</p>
            <p>Next the bot will ask you what action you’d like to perform.</p>
            <p>Every class has it’s own ability. Pick the first ability and write it out without -. </p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p><strong>-fight, Yes, Stab.</strong> </p>
            ‍
            <p>When you have answered you will deal damage to the mob and the mob to you.</p>
            <p>You can repeat attacking with the <strong>-fight</strong> command.</p>

            <p>You will fight this monster until it is dead and then it will give you rewards.</p>
            <p>After that the <strong>-fight</strong> command seeks a new enemy.</p>

            <p>Do not forget to heal, the monster deals damage first so if you don’t watch your health you die. </p>
