            <h1>Version 4.0.0 is out now!</h1>
            <p>Hey guys, small update ahum, I may have not yet had the time to write this out decently so some things will already be known, but formality and oversight still drive me to put this here.</p> 

            <p>So first off some skills have been adapted:</p>
            <p>Cosmetically:</p> 
            <li>- Stab, some text improvement.</li>
            <li>- Parry, some text improvement.</li>
            <li>- Stun+Arise combo, now shows accurate damage and text. </li>
            <li>- Reap+Arise combo, no longer shows inaccurate text. </li>

            <p>Effectively:</p> 
            <li>- Reap+Arise combo, re-balanced, due to overpowering the user does not also attack. </li>
            <li>- Overload, skill has been fixed, should now work as intended. </li>

            <p>‚öîÔ∏è A lot of changes have been made behind the scenes, involving mostly the fight command, reducing the worst of the lag we've had. The math behind the fight command has been simplified in order to work faster as well. </p>

            <p>‚ú® Cosmetically we have fixed quite a sum of typo's throughout all the commands, I will not list them seperately for the sake of convenience. Feel free to keep pointing them out to us though!</p> 

            <p>As for the latest addition, Pets has been modified, including:</p>
            <li>- A pat command, you can now give your pets love and affection, however the friendship level is as of now cosmetic. </li>
            <li>- Pet feed command, pet feed currently obtainable through give-aways and soon other sources can be fed to pets to increase their exp level, every level increases their active/passive abilities. </li>
            <li>- Pet spawning rates and spawn message colours have been adapted, each pet has their own spawn colour to stand out amongst all the other messages.  Failing to catch a pet results in a red lined message. </li>
            <li>- Pet name changes now correctly edit the name of the equipped pet in stats too. </li>
            <li>- Fixed spelling mistakes here too oops</li>
            <p>üîñ Next up is the Wiki, changes to this include:</p>
            <li>- Wiki spawnrate command, shows all the spawn-rates for loot and pets.</li>
            <li>- Wiki traps, now actually an existing command with the overview of stats and rules for how these work. </li>
            <li>- The existing wiki skills have been fixed, to accurately show each skill. </li>
            <li>- All classes and new skills have been added. </li>
